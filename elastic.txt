The aspiration toward such objective knowledge belongs to the highest of which man is capabIe, and you will certainly not suspect me of wishing to belittle the achievements and the heroic efforts of man in this sphere. Yet it is equally clear that knowledge of what is does not open the door directly to what should be. One can have the clearest and most complete knowledge of what is, and yet not be able to deduct from that what should be the goal of our human aspirations. Objective knowledge provides us with powerful instruments for the achievements of certain ends, but the ultimate goal itself and the longing to reach it must come from another source. And it is hardly necessary to argue for the view that our existence and our activity acquire meaning only by the setting up of such a goal and of corresponding values. The knowledge of truth as such is wonderful, but it is so little capable of acting as a guide that it cannot prove even the justification and the value of the aspiration toward that very knowledge of truth. Here we face, therefore, the limits of the purely rational conception of our existence."},

It would not be good to start, for example, with the question How do mathematicians prove theorems? This question introduces an interesting topic, but to start with it would be to project two hidden assumptions: (1) that there is uniform, objective and ?rmly established theory and practice of mathematical proof, and (2) that progress made by mathematicians consists of proving theorems. It is worthwhile to examine these hypotheses, rather than to accept them as obvious and proceed from there. The question is not even How do mathematicians make progress in mathematics? Rather, as a more explicit (and leading) form of the question, I prefer How do mathematicians advance human understanding of mathematics.",
